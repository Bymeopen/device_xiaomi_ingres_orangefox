# Crypto
# On the old fox_12.1 source, TW_INCLUDE_CRYPTO=true crashed (SIGABRT in
# "Retrieving key from keymaster") because it linked the legacy HIDL Keymaster
# wrapper, and this device's vendor partition only exposes modern KeyMint AIDL.
# This fox_14.1 tree's system/vold/Keystore.cpp already talks to
# android.system.keystore2.IKeystoreService (KeyMint AIDL) instead, and
# bootable/recovery/Android.mk links libkeymint_support /
# lib_android_keymaster_keymint_utils when this is true -- so re-enabling it
# here should let /data actually mount instead of permanently failing with
# "Unable to mount /data" / "Unable to recreate /data/media folder.".
# UPDATE: first test hung forever at the OrangeFox splash logo (adb still
# responsive, so not the old full hang -- just vold blocked). Root cause:
# device/qcom/twrp-common/crypto/init.recovery.qcom_decrypt.rc (which sets
# crypto.ready=1 and starts keymint-qti -- required for vold's read_key() to
# unwrap the hw-wrapped metadata key) was never being packaged into the
# ramdisk at all, because BOARD_USES_QCOM_FBE_DECRYPTION was never set here.

# UPDATE 2 (historical): both available keymint HAL binaries were broken --
# our own bundled /system/bin/android.hardware.security.keymint-service-qti
# failed to link (needs android.hardware.security.keymint-V1-ndk_platform.so,
# which only exists inside an APEX module recovery never mounts), and the
# vendor's own referenced /vendor/bin/hw/android.hardware.security.
# onekeymint-service-qti simply doesn't exist on this vendor image. Real fix:
# pulled the real, working /vendor/bin/hw/android.hardware.security.
# keymint-service-qti binary plus its 3 APEX-only .so dependencies
# (keymint/secureclock/sharedsecret -V1-ndk_platform.so) straight off a
# normally-booted, rooted HyperOS system, and bundled them into this device
# tree's recovery ramdisk (recovery/root/vendor/{bin/hw,lib64}/) instead of
# relying on the AOSP-compiled or vendor-declared-but-missing versions. Also
# had to delete two STALE prebuilt files that were already sitting in this
# device tree since the fox_12.1 era (recovery/root/system/bin/android.
# hardware.security.keymint-service-qti and recovery/root/vendor/etc/init/
# android.hardware.security.keymint-service-qti.rc) -- they defined a SECOND,
# conflicting "keymint-qti" service pointing at the broken binary, silently
# overriding/colliding with twrp-common's correct service definition even
# after that one was fixed. Confirmed via `ps` that the real binary now
# starts and stays running (no crash-loop). OF_SKIP_FBE_DECRYPTION is no
# longer needed -- removed so the real decrypt attempt actually runs.

# Neither excluding the kernel (reusing boot_a's) nor embedding the real HyperOS stock
# kernel fixed the boot failure, and controlled testing proved the bootloader tolerates
# kernel/DTB mismatches fine (stock HyperOS recovery ramdisk booted to a real UI using
# PixelOS's own boot_a kernel/vendor_boot/dtbo) -- so the remaining variable is our own
# ramdisk. When the kernel is excluded, boot_a's own baked-in cmdline is used instead of
# ours, which meant our console=tty0/earlyprintk=fb debug flags were silently never
# applied on any prior test. Embedding PixelOS's own kernel Image here (byte-identical to
# what's already in boot_a) keeps the kernel/DTB pairing that's proven to work AND makes
# our own BOARD_KERNEL_CMDLINE (with the debug console flags) actually take effect, so we
# can finally see real crash/panic output if the ramdisk itself is what's failing.
#
# Update: embedding a kernel never mattered either way (self-built, stock HyperOS, and
# PixelOS-matching all hung identically) -- the real bugs turned out to be TW_INCLUDE_CRYPTO
# (Keymaster HIDL 4.x abort, now disabled above) and modules.load.recovery (now emptied).
# Re-enabling kernel exclusion so recovery transparently reuses whatever ROM's boot_a
# kernel is currently flashed (the actual goal: works across every ROM on ingres), now
# combined with both fixes for the first time.
